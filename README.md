# Wombats Documentation 
This repository provides documentation for all Wombat repos including [Wombats API](https://github.com/willowtreeapps/wombats-api), [Wombats Web Client](https://github.com/willowtreeapps/wombats-web-client), [Wombat Bots](https://github.com/willowtreeapps/wombats-bots), and [Wombat Lamba](https://github.com/willowtreeapps/wombats-lambda).

## What is Wombats?
Wombats is an interactive game to learn Clojure and AI strategy. Create a wombat (bot), join a game, and watch your Clojure code play out in an arena against your fellow competitors!

We hope that with this game, users will hone their Clojure skills and gain exposure to Open Source projects (and contribute!). 

## How to play
* Go to our [Wombat Bots](https://github.com/willowtreeapps/wombats-bots) repo and fork to your personal repo.
* Navigate to [wombats.io](http://qa.wombats.io/#/) 
* Click Login
* Give our github access to your github account
* Go to My Wombats

* Wombat URL format: `<your github username>/wombats-bots/contents/wombat-sample.clj`
* Go to Games

* Click Join
* Enter password if applicable, choose the wombat you just created, select a color and then join!
* Click the game card that you just joined to navigate to that game.
