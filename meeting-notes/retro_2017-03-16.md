## The Good
- Alpha launch events went well, including LnL, workshop and Wombats:30
- Maintained reasonable workload
- Reduced tech debt
- Added Linter
- Beefed up support for open-source, including templates and changelogs
- Build out beta roadmap
- Focused on Github use, including bringing on Jesse

## The Not Good
- Last-minute deployments, especially before demos (LnL, Wombats:30)
- Missing dedication to automated testing
- Lack of QA & design on team
- Working lunches were common
- Inconsistent handlers on the API

## Next Steps
- Deploy to QA every Thursday at 1pm
- Dedicate Fridays to fixing bugs before deploying to Prod
- Schedule a recurring workshop 
- Include end-to-end testing and automating testing in Roadmap estimates
