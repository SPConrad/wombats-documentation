# Introduction
Hey! Thanks for considering contributing to our world of Wombats!

There's a few things to know before you get started so please read carefully. 

Our guidelines are intended to help the communication between the developers managing the project (us) and the developers contributing (you!). We promise to address your issues, proposed changes, and PRs if you promise to respect our time and our feedback.
There are many ways to contribute to an open source project. We're always looking for improved documentation, bug fixes, and feature development and maintain a list of tickets for you to peruse. Please don't use issues as a way to ask support questions. We have a support channel in our [Slack organization](https://wombats-hq.slack.com/) to help! You can also ask questions in the [Clojurian slack organization](http://clojurians.net/).

## Ground Rules
* [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/willowtreeapps/wombats-documentation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md)
* Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss with a maintainer what you wish to implement before submitting a PR. 
* Keep your status on tickets up to date!
* Love Clojure :)

## Your First Contribution

Unsure where to start? If you haven't looked at clojure before, we recommend looking over [Clojure for the Brave and True](http://www.braveclojure.com/) to start learning the language. 

We also are curating a list of Beginner Issues to get your toes wet. Stay tuned!

## Getting Started
1. Create your own fork of the code.
2. Implement changes in the fork.
3. If you like the change and think Wombats would benefit, send us a PR tagging the documented issue for the feature/bug.

## Reporting a bug!
If security is a vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email emily.seibert@willowtreeapps.com instead.

Answer the following 5 questions when submitting an issue:

1. What version of the project are you using?
2. What browser and its version are you using?
3. What did you do? (Steps to Replicate Issue)
4. What did you expect to see?
5. What did you see instead?

## Suggesting something cool for Wombats
Open an issue on Github which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work. Include any relevant documentation that will help prompt a discussion!

## Code Reviews 
We the maintainers will review PRs on a regular basis (we promise). Any feedback will be directly submitted on the PR. Any discussion from the PR that introduces side-effect PRs/documentation will be documented when the PR is closed. After feedback has been given we expect responses within two weeks. After two weeks we may close the PR if it isn't showing activity.
